## Final Status Report:
### Completed:
During the semester, we were able to complete scripts for downloading and extracting clues and responses from html files on J-archive. Using these scripts, 
we were able to create a database of clues sorted into six different categories: Geography, History, Literature, Pop Culture, Science, and Sports. Our database
includes 10 clues in each category, which is enough for one full game of Jeopardy. These clues are stored in the clues subdirectory, while the correct responses
are in the answers subdirectory. 

Using these clues and responses, we were also able to create a SQL database consisting of five different tables. These are PLAYER, GAME, CATEGORY, CLUE_ANSWER, and
GAME_LOG. Further information on the purpose of each table and the necessary testing can be found in the file [SQL_TESTING.md](https://github.com/byrne-saw/team_tbd_sdtm_spr_2024/blob/main/SQL_TESTING.md).

### In the middle:
At this time, we were in the middle of implementing the game board. Currently, we are able to visit our website, input a username, and see a mock-up game board.
We were in the middle of changing this so that our game board is populated from our categories databse. Also, we were in the middle of implementing a 
multi-player option in addition to the single-player option.

### Future Plans:
In the future, we plan on implementing a feature that allows the user to choose categories. As of right now, the game board is automatically populated, but we would like to
allow the user more control over the game by allowing them to choose categories instead of getting a completely random game. Along with this, we planned to expand our 
database of clues and responses in the future. This would make our game less repetitive, and allow the user more customization. As we gather more clues, we planned on adding
categories, both general and more specific, to ensure that anyone who plays our game can pick categories that they are intersted in.
