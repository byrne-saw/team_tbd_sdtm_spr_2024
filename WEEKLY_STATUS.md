# JeoparDIY Weekly Updates

## Week 3 Satuts:

Five different categories have been created: Geography, History, Pop Culture, Literature, and Sports. In each category, there are 10 possible clues taken fron three different Jeopardy games. The game ids used are 3942, 6885, and 8212. These clues and categories will serve as a basis to test populating our data base, choosing the categories, and randomizing the clues. As we get this working, more clues and categories can be added to allow the user extra customization.
